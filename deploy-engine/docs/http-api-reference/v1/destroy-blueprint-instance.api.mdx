Destroys a blueprint deployment instance.

This is a `POST` request as destroying a blueprint instance requires additional information
beyond the ID of the instance to destroy and `DELETE` requests do not support request bodies.

This will start the destroy process for the provided change set.
It will return the current state of the blueprint instance, the same ID provided
should be used to stream destroy events as they occur.
