bucket.\n  - `gcs`: The blueprint document is located in a GCS bucket.\n  - `azureblob`: The blueprint document is located in an Azure Blob Storage container.\n  - `https`: The blueprint document is located via a public HTTPS URL.\n\nFor remote source authentication, the Deploy Engine server will need to be configured\nwith the appropriate credentials to access the remote source.\nAuthentication
