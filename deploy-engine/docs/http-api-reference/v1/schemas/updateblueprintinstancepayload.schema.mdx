instance update.\nWhen updating an existing blueprint instance (deploying), a change set is used instead\nof the deployment process re-computing the changes that need to be applied.\n\nThe source blueprint document is still required in addition to a change set\nto finish of resolving substitutions that can only be resolved at deploy time\nand for deployment orchestration.\nThe source blueprint

determine where the blueprint document is located.\n\nThis can be one of the following:\n  - `file`: The blueprint document is located on the local file system of the Deploy Engine server.\n  - `s3`: The blueprint document is located in an S3 bucket.\n  - `gcs`: The blueprint document is located in a GCS bucket.\n  - `azureblob`: The blueprint document is located in an Azure Blob Storage container.\n  - `https`: The blueprint document is located via a public HTTPS URL.\n\nFor remote source authentication, the Deploy Engine server will need to be configured\nwith the appropriate

`file` sources, this must be an absolute path to the directory on the local file system of the Deploy Engine server.\nAn example for a `file` source would be `/path/to/blueprint-directory`.\nFor `s3`, `gcs` and `azureblob` sources, this must be the path to the virtual directory where the first path segment\nis the bucket/container name and the rest of the path is the path to the virtual directory.\nAn example for a remote object storage source would be `bucket-name/path/to/blueprint-directory`.\nFor `https` sources, this must be the path to the blueprint document,\na host must be supplied in the `blueprintLocationMetadata` field.\nAn example for a `https` source would be `/path/to/blueprint-directory` with a\n`blueprintLocationMetadata.host` field set to `example.com`.\n","example":"/path/to/blueprint-directory"},"blueprintFile":{"type":"string","description":"The name of the blueprint file to be used during deployment.\nThe source file is needed in
