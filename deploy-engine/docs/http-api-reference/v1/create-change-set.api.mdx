Create a change set for a blueprint deployment.
This will start a change staging process for the provided blueprint
document and return an ID that can be used to retrieve the change set
or stream change staging events.

If a valid instance ID or name is provided, a change set will be created
by comparing the provided blueprint document with the current state of the existing
blueprint instance.

Creating a change set should be carried out in preparation for deploying new
blueprint instances or updating existing blueprint instances.
