# Overview

This section provides a registry of all the resource types that come with the selected version of the Build Engine.
The [plugin system](../plugins/plugin-system) can be used to extend the Build Engine with additional resource types; in the future, community-provided sources for collections of resource types will be mentioned here.

The top level resource types are the native `celerity/*` resource types that are versioned separately from the Build Engine.
This registry provides links to the documentation for `celerity/*` resource types with their respective versions.
